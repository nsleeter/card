        We're sorry to hear that you undergoing surgery, and hope that you
        recover soon. We thought about circulating a card to each and every
        person, and then delivering it last of all to you. And then we thought
        better of it. So here&rsquo;s a card to wish you well the way that only
        RRCHNM can make one.
      </p>
      <p>Best wishes,<br />The RRCHNM Team</p>

        Hope your knee is better and that you are back on the trail soon! Thanks
        for a great first year as director.

    Mills, 
    Congrats on your first year as RRCHNM director. You've handled these extreme circumstances as well as possible 
    and I'm confident that the Center is well positioned to handle the zombie attack and alien invasion that's surely coming in 2021. 
    I hope your recovery goes smoothly. Since you always have a great joke or a story about Eastern Europe to share, 
    I want to share my absolute favorite Eastern European under Communism joke:
    Q: Why do the Czech People's Militia always travel in threes?
    A: Because they need one to write the citation, one to read the citation, and one to keep an eye on the two dangerous intellectuals. 
   
     &mdash;Nate
